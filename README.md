# Eficient Frontier

We are two people with backgrounds in economics and finance who wanted to try our hand at creating a python code to analize a list of stocks and obtain an eficient frontier portfolio.

The code is structured in 3 parts, first we define the list of stocks to download in our case we chose the stocks in the SP500 and obtain historic data for each stock. After that we greatly reduce the amount of stocks using a series of filters based on financial ratios. And lastly we take the resulting list of stocks and apply markowicz to calculate the eficient frontier and the resulting highest sharpe ratio portfolio and the lowest volatility portfolio.
